        #   in the future, this can be used for more fun/interesting user

        # shorthand 'symbols' are aliases that the director automatically
        # assigns to database coverage objects. these special aliases
        # consist of a single capital letter, eg 'A'
        #
        # these auto-aliased shorthand symbols were intended to be a less
        # cumbersome way to reference specific coverage sets while composing.
        #
        # Example -
        #
        #  given these shorthand aliases:
        #
        #   'A' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.04936.0000.proc.log'
        #   'B' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.03297.0000.proc.log'
        #   'C' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.08438.0000.proc.log'
        #   'D' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.02349.0000.proc.log'
        #   ...
        #   'Z' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.50946.0000.proc.log'
        #   <eof>
        #
        #  one can more naturally compose interesting equations
        #
        #   ((A & B) | (D & (E - F))) | Z
        #
        # the existing limitation of shorthand symbols is that there is
        # only 26 (A-Z) aliases that can be assigned to coverage sets. There
        # is no immediate plans to further expand this range.
        #
        # the primary justification for this limitation is that I don't
        # expect users to be building complex compositions with 26+ coverage
        # sets loaded at once. At that point, shorthand aliases really
